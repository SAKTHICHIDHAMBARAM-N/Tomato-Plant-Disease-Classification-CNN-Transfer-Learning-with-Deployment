# Tomato-Plant-Disease-Classification-CNN-Transfer-Learning-with-Deployment

# Description
   Tomato is the most popular crop in the world and in every kitchen, it is found in different forms irrespective of the cuisine. After potato and sweet potato, it is the crop which is cultivated worldwide. India ranked 2 in the production of tomato. However, the quality and quantity of tomato crop goes down due to the various kinds of diseases. so in this problem we will use deep learning technique to detect and classify tomato plant diseases.
 
 # Objective
 To build Web-App for identiying and classifying Tomato Plant Diseases.

 Dataset consists of 10 Categories of Tomato Plant diseases which are labelled as:
 
 0 - Tomato_Early_blight
 
 1 - Tomato_healthy
 
 2 - Tomato_Tomato_mosaic_virus
 
 3 - Tomato_Tomato_Yellow_Leaf_Curl_Virus
 
 4 - Tomato_Late_blight
 
 5 - Tomato_Target_Spot
 
 6 - Tomato_Septoria_leaf_spot
 
 7 - Tomato_Bacterial_spot
 
 8 - Tomato_Spider_mites Two-spotted_spider_mite
 
 9 - Tomato_Leaf_Mold
 
 # Models used
 Built models using transer learning methods like VGG16 and InceptionV3 with validation accuracy of 93% and 89%.
 
 # Model Deployment
 Used Flask framework for deployment with the best model(VGG16).
